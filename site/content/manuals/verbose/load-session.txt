load-session - Import session from file

USAGE:
  load-session

DESCRIPTION:
  Imports a previously saved session file, restoring all files that were
  in your virtual filesystem when the session was saved.

EXAMPLES:
  load-session            Import a session file

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. File picker dialog appears
  2. Select a previously saved session JSON file
  3. All files from that session are loaded into memory
  4. Files are now accessible in the virtual filesystem

NOTES:
  - Only accepts valid session JSON files (created by 'save-session')
  - Checks file version for compatibility
  - Files are loaded into the paths they had when saved
  - Existing files with same paths will be overwritten
  - Use after page reload to restore your previous work
