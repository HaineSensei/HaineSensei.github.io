load - Upload file to virtual filesystem

USAGE:
  load FILENAME

DESCRIPTION:
  Uploads a file from your device into the virtual filesystem at the
  current directory location with the specified filename.

EXAMPLES:
  load notes.txt          Upload file as notes.txt in current directory
  load draft.md           Upload file as draft.md

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. You run the command with desired filename
  2. File picker dialog appears
  3. Select a file from your device
  4. File is uploaded to virtual filesystem with given name
  5. File is now accessible via 'cat', 'edit', etc.

NOTES:
  - File is uploaded to your current working directory
  - The filename you specify doesn't have to match the original filename
  - Files are stored in browser memory
  - Use 'save' to download files back to your device
  - Files persist until page reload (unless saved via 'save-session')
