cat - Display file contents

USAGE:
  cat FILE

DESCRIPTION:
  Displays the contents of a file. Works with both static content files
  and user-created files in the virtual filesystem.

EXAMPLES:
  cat about.txt           Display about.txt in current directory
  cat blog/post.md        Display post.md in blog subdirectory
  cat /contact.txt        Display contact.txt using absolute path

NOTES:
  - Static content files are fetched from the server when first accessed
  - User-created files (via 'edit') are stored in browser memory
  - The file must exist in the filesystem
  - Use 'ls' to see available files in a directory
