gol - Conway's Game of Life

USAGE:
  gol

DESCRIPTION:
  Opens an interactive, GPU-accelerated implementation of Conway's
  Game of Life in a new browser tab. The simulation runs entirely
  on your graphics card using WebGL2 shaders.

FEATURES:
  - GPU acceleration via WebGL2 compute shaders
  - Interactive mouse drawing (click & drag to add cells)
  - Pause/play, single-step, randomize, and clear controls
  - Random border mode (toggle with 'B' key)
  - Real-time FPS and generation counter
  - Runs at native screen resolution

CONTROLS:
  Mouse:      Click & drag to draw living cells
  SPACE:      Pause/resume simulation
  H:          Hide/show UI overlay
  B:          Toggle random border mode
  Buttons:    PAUSE, STEP, RANDOM, CLEAR

HOW IT WORKS:
  Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells live
  or die based on simple rules:
  - Living cell with 2-3 neighbors: survives
  - Dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors: becomes alive
  - All other cells: die or stay dead

  This implementation uses GPU fragment shaders to compute the
  next generation in parallel for every pixel on screen, achieving
  high performance even at large resolutions.

CREDITS:
  Implementation generated by Claude (claude.ai) in response to:
  "Is it possible to make a GPU-accelerated Game of Life program?"

NOTES:
  - Requires WebGL2 support (modern browsers)
  - Performance scales with screen resolution
  - Random border mode creates infinite variety by randomizing
    the outermost pixels each frame
  - The simulation uses "ping-pong" rendering (swapping between
    two framebuffers) to read the previous state while writing
    the next state
