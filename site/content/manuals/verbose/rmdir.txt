rmdir - Remove directory

USAGE:
  rmdir DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION:
  Removes an empty directory from the virtual filesystem.
  The directory must be empty before it can be removed.

EXAMPLES:
  rmdir notes             Remove 'notes' directory from current location
  rmdir blog/drafts       Remove 'drafts' subdirectory from blog
  rmdir /olddir           Remove 'olddir' from root

NOTES:
  - Only removes directories from virtual filesystem (browser memory)
  - Directory must be empty (no files or subdirectories)
  - Use 'rm' to remove files before removing a directory
  - Cannot remove static content directories
  - There is no undo - the directory is permanently removed from memory
