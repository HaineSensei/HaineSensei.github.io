save-session - Export session to file

USAGE:
  save-session

DESCRIPTION:
  Exports all in-memory files (user-created content) to a JSON session
  file that can be downloaded to your device. This allows you to preserve
  your work across browser sessions.

EXAMPLES:
  save-session            Export all in-memory files

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. All files in virtual filesystem are collected
  2. They are bundled into a JSON format
  3. File is downloaded with timestamp in filename
  4. You can later restore this session with 'load-session'

OUTPUT FILE:
  - Filename: session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json
  - Format: JSON with version and file paths/contents
  - Contains only in-memory files, not static content

NOTES:
  - Useful for preserving work between sessions
  - Only exports user-created files, not site content
  - Can be loaded back with 'load-session' command
  - Consider saving regularly to avoid losing work
