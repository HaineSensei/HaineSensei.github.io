mkdir - Create directory

USAGE:
  mkdir DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION:
  Creates a new directory in the virtual filesystem.

EXAMPLES:
  mkdir notes             Create 'notes' directory in current location
  mkdir blog/drafts       Create 'drafts' subdirectory in blog
  mkdir /projects         Create 'projects' directory in root

NOTES:
  - Creates directory in the virtual filesystem (browser memory)
  - Directory persists until page reload (unless saved via session)
  - Use 'ls' to verify the directory was created
  - Use 'cd' to navigate into the new directory
  - Cannot create nested directories in one command
