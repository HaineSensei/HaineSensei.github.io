pretty - Render markdown/html file

USAGE:
  pretty FILE

DESCRIPTION:
  Renders a markdown/html file with LaTeX support in a new 
  browser tab, providing a nicely formatted view of the content.

EXAMPLES:
  pretty notes.md             Render notes.md
  pretty blog/post.md         Render post.md from blog directory
  pretty /README.md           Render README.md from root

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. File content is loaded from filesystem
  2. A new tab opens with rendered markdown
  3. LaTeX math expressions are rendered using KaTeX
  4. The rendered view is read-only

NOTES:
  - Best used with .md (markdown) files or .html files
  - Supports LaTeX math: inline $...$ and display $$...$$
  - If you specify a non-.md/.html file, you'll be prompted to confirm
  - Works with both static content and user-created files
  - The tab can be closed when you're done viewing
