rm - Remove file

USAGE:
  rm FILE

DESCRIPTION:
  Removes a file from the virtual filesystem. Only works with in-memory
  files (user-created files), not static content files.

EXAMPLES:
  rm notes.txt            Remove notes.txt from current directory
  rm blog/draft.md        Remove draft.md from blog directory
  rm /oldfile.txt         Remove oldfile.txt from root

NOTES:
  - Only removes files from virtual filesystem (browser memory)
  - Cannot remove static content files from the server
  - Cannot remove directories (use 'rmdir' for that)
  - There is no undo - the file is permanently removed from memory
  - This does not affect saved files on your device
