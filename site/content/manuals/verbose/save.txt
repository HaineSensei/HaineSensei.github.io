save - Download file to device

USAGE:
  save FILE

DESCRIPTION:
  Downloads a file from the virtual filesystem to your device.
  Only works with files that exist in memory (user-created files).

EXAMPLES:
  save notes.txt          Download notes.txt
  save blog/draft.md      Download draft.md from blog directory
  save /myfile.txt        Download myfile.txt from root

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. The file content is retrieved from virtual filesystem
  2. Your browser's download dialog appears
  3. You can choose where to save the file on your device

NOTES:
  - Only works with in-memory files (created via 'edit' or 'load')
  - Cannot save static content files (use browser's save feature instead)
  - The file remains in the virtual filesystem after saving
  - For backing up multiple files, use 'save-session' instead
