CONGRATULATIONS, YOU FOUND MY FILESYSTEM BACKDOOR! 
I'm proud of you, I think I know what you probably did:
You created your own cave_of_dice directory elsewhere causing this directory to be uninitialised and treated like a normal abyss directory.

There are other ways to reach this, but this is the most user-facing way I know. (It was unintended behaviour that I noticed that was sufficiently unlikely to happen by accident that it was worth rewarding.)

Have you found my other secrets yet? I love cheese btw, particularly cheddar and red leicester. 

P.S. If you did create your own cave_of_dice, you might still be able to find the real cave_of_dice within.
